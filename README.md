# Discord-Minecraft Bot

I'm not entirely sure why the original was taken down, but I at least will find it useful, so I've reimplemented it in English here.
In my use case, the server is directly facing the web, so the ngrok interface is disabled.
I've also provided a couple of comments or changed the names of things to better document what they do.
